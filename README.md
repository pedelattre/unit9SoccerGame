===============

I started to work on this project on Friday, October 17th 2014.

Here is a quick description of the project:

The global game idea comes from Otto-Ville Ojalaâ€™s Soccer Physics.
The player will be able to jump and kick the ball.

In a first time I created graphics thanks to Adobe Illustrator, to be able to use sprite with my app.

On Saturday, I started the development on Xcode.
My idea was to use a classic MVC model to develop this app.

Unfortunately, I recently updated Xcode to the 6th version which has a lot of problems with Cocos2D. It took me the entire morning to try to find a solution to my problem. Finally I decided to download Xcode 5.
I finally started the development during the afternoon. By the end of the day I created the model part for the player.
I had to stop my work on this application because of other work I had to do for the school.

I hope I will be able to work on it again asap.
